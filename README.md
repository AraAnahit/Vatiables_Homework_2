This repository is for variables and homework concerning it. 
I read all materials and did 6 task from possibly 9 task. 
I tried to changed exercises in the task to practice my understanding of material.
For solving task 7,8,9 I need more time and more deeply understanding of the material, especially "function part". 
Also this time I tried to follow Conventional Commits rules. There can be a problems, need to discuss with tutor.
